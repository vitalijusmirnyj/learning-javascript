/*
Write a function that will accept an array of numbers and will return a new array with all 0 numbers moved to the end of the array without
 changing the order of non-zero elements.
For example:
[1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4] - should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0]
Hint: consider using splice and push array methods to solve it.
